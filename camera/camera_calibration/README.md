# Camera Calibration

This repository provides camera calibration tools for two different ROS versions: ROS2 Foxy and ROS2 Rolling.

## Folder Structure
- **ros2_foxy**: Contains calibration scripts and assets for ROS2 Foxy.
- **ros2_rolling**: Contains calibration scripts for ROS2 Rolling.

## Recommendation
It is **highly recommended** to use the calibration program in the `ros2_rolling` folder. The ROS2 Rolling version:
- Allows users to hold the calibration board further back, resulting in improved calibration accuracy.
- Includes optimizations for better performance.

Please refer to the respective `README.md` files in the `ros2_foxy` and `ros2_rolling` folders for detailed instructions on usage.
